The main purpose of this project was to practice an initial **Machine Learning** model; specifically, a ***Logistic Regression*** model.

**1**. I looked for a dataset on Kaggle. 
  I took one having info about the **"Rugby Results"** of most important Teams (South Africa, Ireland, New Zealand, England, France,...) since 1871 up to December 2024.
